i dont agree with the previous reviewer at all. my kids love everything in this book and if i find enough time i want to make every single toy. they are not scary looking at all. if you like knitted babes by claire garland, you ll love this one. there are 5 themes in this book: enchanted land: Princess and castle fairy dream: fairy and baby, flower pillow, unicornwild trail: cowboy and mustangset to sea: pirate and ratty, dinghymagical waterworld: Mermaid, fish, seahorse and crab, dolphinthere are also pages on knitting, crochet and stitching basics. this is probably not a book for a beginner, but if have some experience you ll want to get your needles, hooks and yarn and just get going. i can only recommend this one. 5 stars!!!
