Another solid text from our friend Sensei Demura. This is part of his popular set on Okinawan Weaponry and well worth the cost. Portrayed in the book is weapon history, basic stances, grips, blocks and strikes. Demura also covers self defense applications against many various attacks. For all Karate and Kobudo students I would reccomend this book
