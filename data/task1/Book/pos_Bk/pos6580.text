Our book club read this book for our February 2006 selection.  It was a really good book, we were all excited about discussing it.  Mr. Johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think.A few members felt that Denmark never loved Sierra but saw her more as property.  The book definitely has some suprises that you don't see coming.  We really enjoyed the book.Sistahs of Ebony Pages
