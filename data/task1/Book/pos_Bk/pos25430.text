   I read The Pig Man by Paul Zindel for a summer vacation assignment. In all, I do not enjoy reading books , but I was surprised by the humor in this book. When I was reading it, I would have to stop reading and I would start laughing. It would take a while to calm myself down.   It first started with John and Lorraine, then a lot of strange things started to happen to them. The old man that they where trying to prank call, was actually going to give them money. When they meet him it all changed. They where worried because they lied to him  and did not know what to do. They told him the truth and became good friends with the Pig Man. They called him the pig man because his name was Mr. Pignati, and he collected hundreds of little pig statues.                      John and Lorraine learned a lot about the importance of life as they grew to love the Pig Man. This sad story has to taught them how to move on after a loved one has died.
