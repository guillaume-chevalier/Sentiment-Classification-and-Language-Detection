I couldn't count how many copies of this book I have purchased.  The most recent was for my third grandchild due later this month. This book is the best there is for the very young child. For each of my own three children, it was a stand-out favorite that was read over and over until overuse required it be replaced. We certainly couldn't be without a copy! Since then, this book is always included whenever I give gifts to new parents. The book is the touchy-feely type so the child explores the soft fur of the bunny, Daddy's scratchy beard, etc.  The only times I hesitated buying it for a new baby was once when the mom was unwed and the father was not involved with her or the child (there is a page on Daddy's beard and one for mother's ring) and another time for a family of color since parents in the book are Caucasian.
