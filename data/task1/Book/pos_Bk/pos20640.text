This book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory.  Molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances.  Molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules, which is, of course, of fundamental importance to the chemist.Bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book.This is a book that I often use as a reference.  This book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas.  It is not a particularly advanced book, but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when I need it
