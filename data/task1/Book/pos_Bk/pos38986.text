I have always been a fan of the STAR WARS saga but never really read any of the Novels. This was my first SW Novel. I must say i want to be a SITH. I just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming. If u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the SW ripple effects. I however got more excited because i played KOTOR/EP3 The game/KOTOR 2 and Jedi Academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games.  I loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the Jedi in EP3.  It an amazing story and can't wait to a sequel if any.
