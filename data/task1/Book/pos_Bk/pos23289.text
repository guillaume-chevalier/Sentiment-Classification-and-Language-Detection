Being a flight attendant myself and looking through the SkyMall magazine countless times on long flights I can tell you...this book is AMAZING. I have never laughed so hard from a book all my life. I really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge. I'm sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it :
