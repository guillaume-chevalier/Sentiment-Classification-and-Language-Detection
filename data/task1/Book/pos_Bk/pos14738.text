I believe that the purpose of this book is to break the bad habbits that every single christian had adoptded and the negative infuences we've been absorving.I think that this book was made simple, so that it would be very easy to read, understand, use and remember the "BE's". It does not anti with anything, it's just conservative with what is believed to be true!It's inspiring that would help anyone who reads to envision grabbing your dreams and on how lucky we are to be in this generation with full of opportunities. Every chapter gives wisdom WHY do we have to BE; Grateful, Smart, Involve, Clean, True, Positive, Humble, Still and Prayerful
