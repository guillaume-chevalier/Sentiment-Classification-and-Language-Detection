Yay--this book was fun and extremely informative.  At first, the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny (to keep it humorous for me, I conjured up in my mind a tall, overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair, hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons).  Anyway, I digress.  As a doctoral graduate student taking a Neuroscience course--this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things.  But ultimately, it helped me make the grade.  If you get the book, make sure to color in it--it really does help (not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day).  Otherwise, what's the use of buying a book like this--it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don't color in it.
