I absolutely think you should have this book as part of your collection.  The pictures come to life along with the description.  The wording is simple and sweet.  I am a first grade teacher and taught using this book.  All my students enjoyed the memory this book brings to life.  Vivid pictures and colors are an absolute gift from the artist
