I chanced upon this book quite by accident.I am a big fan of books which inspire.This may not be a book which is high on the literary quotient, the writing does get rambling and long winded quite a number of times.But whats truly awe inspiring is its straight up from the heart.Its quite amazing that someone can go through so many emotions in a lifetime and actually make peace with all thats happened in a lifetime.This book will give you plenty to think about long after you are done with it
