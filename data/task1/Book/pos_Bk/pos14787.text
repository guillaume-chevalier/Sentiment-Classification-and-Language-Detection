Well written and fully documented. I confess that I knew very little about the beginings of Islam or its constant bloodshed.Anywhere Islam becomes entrenched, freedom is taken away and civilizations are destroyed. Hatred is not discouraged but encouraged. Islam's world view is this in a nutshell, do it our way or perish. This book will rob you of your sleep
