Having had the delight of living in St. Andrews and traveling over most of Scotland playing golf, Allan's book is the best I have seen, by far, for describing the reality of golf, travel, and living in Scotland. He sugarcoats nothing, his opinion mirrors mine, and he is interested is ensuring his readers know exactly what to expect and know exactly how to best user their time and travel dollars. Even with my Scottish experience and contacts, his book is my golf/travel in Scotland bible.
