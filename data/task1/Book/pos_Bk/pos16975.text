I enjoyed this book,but then again I always enjoy  Sue Miller's novels.She has this way of making me feel close to her main characters.  So anyway Sue,Is Lottie Ok? Has she found contentment in life? Please write me at  Babz@aol.com.  I am about to read &quot;The Distinguished Guest&quot;--I  heard it was really great!  I'll let you know. Bar
