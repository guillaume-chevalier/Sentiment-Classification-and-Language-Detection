I was introduced to this book while staying with a friend, and I was hooked.  I went home and bought it so that I could finish it.  I didn't know much about Buddhism before I read this book.  Ms. Boorstein's stories read a bit like the Chicken Soup for the Soul books.  She has short wonderful stories that demonstate current day people practicing  the Buddha's teachings.  You do not need to be a Buddhist to appreciate this book!  It's very inspirational.  Since this book, I have read several more books to learn about the teachings of Buddha
