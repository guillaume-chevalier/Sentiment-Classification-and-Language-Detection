This is a great beginners book. It's easy to read and follow along. Silver's other books are great to start out with as well. Other great starter books are "Wicca" by Scott Cunningham,"Witch Crafting" & "Book of Shaddows" by Phyllis Curott, these authors will help you get started very well. Also I recommend "The Witches Almanac" by Elizabeth Pepper, this is a witches must have on her shelf. Happy readings.....
