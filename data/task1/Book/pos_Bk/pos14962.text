That about says it all. Bill Bryson is a hilarious writer. I like reading grammar books anyway, but I was always excited to read this book, as it's so entertaining.Besides that, it can teach (or remind) you of a lot of good rules of writing.The main problem is that several entries are unnecessary, and some necessary entries are left out.
