I'll be honest, I don't like fiction books.  But I've got to tell you, A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe has changed my mind.  Mr. Cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place.  The twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience.  You don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel.  Can lightning strike twice?  Absolutely
