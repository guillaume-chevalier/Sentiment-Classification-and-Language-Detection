                                Walk Two Moons                                Sharon Creech                                 Joan Gray 				 Mrs. Cooper	 In this heart- touching, heart-warming story about Sal and her past comes together binding wonderful stories of her and her best friend, Phoebe. Her grandparents take her on a road trip. Along the way, she describes her happy, sad, and beautiful stories. Touching you heart one story at a time.	I loved this book. It was not only a good, but also a great book because, it teaches life lessons, and it's sad in many ways, at the same time beautiful. This book teaches you that life is there, you have time. It also teaches not to judge `a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins'. And to not let sad things effect you, and so much more! I love this book so much.	If you're fifth grade or older, no matter what it will touch your heart. I would suggest it any day. It will be a page-turner from beginning to end. You'll never put it down. So pick it up and start reading it!
