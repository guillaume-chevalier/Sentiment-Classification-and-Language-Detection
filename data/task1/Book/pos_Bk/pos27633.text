Luc Ferry raises some very important and pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology.  Does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an authoritarian social structure?  Does deep ecology demand a level of political correctness which places its premises beyond question?   Ferry is not the first to raise these questions.  The Institute for Social Ecology, led by Murray Bookchin, has made the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter.    Of course, there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology, but they do not make up the whole story.  Particularly glaring is Ferry's one-sided depiction of eco-feminism.  In fact, some eco-feminist work in the U.S. has been particularly sharp at questioning the orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism. The questions which occupy Ferry should be asked by every person who is involved in radical ecology, and many of his criticisms are on-target for a specific body of work.  But he doesn't bother to see the whole picture, and readers should be careful to read beyond the quotes cited by Ferry and to study deep ecology and ecofeminism on their own terms
