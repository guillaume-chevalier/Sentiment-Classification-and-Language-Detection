"The Player" provided a trip back in time to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century through the times of the first World War.  To understand what Mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing.  Not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control, he realized that he was a role model for others, not only the young kids that idolized him, but the everyday american worker.  To know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field, his charity work, volunteering for WWI at the age of 37, gives us a better insight to the individual.The book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game, before the Black Sox scandal.  He knew it was going on, tried to warn others, but no one would listen.  A great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time.  One that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today's game
