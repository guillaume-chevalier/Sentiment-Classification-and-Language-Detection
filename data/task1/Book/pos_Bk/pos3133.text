This author has written "Kitchen Table Wisdom" which was recommended to me a year ago by my doctor..Ms Remen remembers her Zayde who died whe she was 7 and tells us all the wonderful things he taught her...She is a physician and therapist and combines the lessons she learned at age 7 with her professional knowledge..I love this book and find myself returning to it time and time again to re-read the stories of strength, refuge and belonging..this book is much more than "chicken soup"...it is "chicken soup with matzo balls
