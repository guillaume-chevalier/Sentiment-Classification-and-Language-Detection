As a History major (undergrad) and former high school history teacher, I marvel at Crichton's ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way. For this reason the Great Train Robbery is for me my favorite Crichton work, even though it may lack the polish of Jurassic Park or Congo or one of his more recent books. TGTR takes us to 19th century London and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery, as well as life in general in 19th century London. So often history books give names, dates, connections, but leave one with the question, "Yes, but what was it like?" Crichton answers this better than any book I ever read on the Sheep Enclosure Act or most any other dry text. Some of it may be fanciful, but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text.At any rate, I highly recommend this book for any Crichton fan, master criminal fan, or interested history student. The main character, whose name escapes me, alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a Hugo or Dumas novel. Very fascinating and rapidly moving.
