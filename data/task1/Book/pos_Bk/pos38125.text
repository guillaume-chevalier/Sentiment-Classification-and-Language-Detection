I found this book to be very helpful. It doesn't just give you the steps to do little tasks like some of the other books I looked at; it explains the features and why you would use them, and shows you how to do things from start to finish.  It also has a lot of helpful hints that aren't related to the exercises--last night my husband installed Vista Business Edition and couldn't find a feature he wanted, and I was able to find the solution immediately in this book
