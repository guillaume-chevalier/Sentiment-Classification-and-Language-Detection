I read The Hundred Penny Box when I was in third grade 13 years ago.  Its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever.  I have created my own Hundred Penny Box and just made one for a friend's newborn son.  My grandfather was recently diagnosed with altzheimers, an illness I assume that great-great-Aunt Dew suffered from.  I took my ratty old copy of the book to his house over Easter.  We read it together and discussed his own memories over the years.  While his memory is fading, I felt it important to hear them myself, love them, and save them in my own memory as Michael did for Aunt Dew.  I would reccomend this book to any child who is losing a grandparent and anyone who needs a good, heartwarming story
