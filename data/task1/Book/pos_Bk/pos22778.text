I'm not a huge fan of this genre of music, but as a very part-time musician, this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician.  I liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining, even if the subject matter was not of immense interest.  This is definitely not the fault of the author, who did a fine job of making this subject engaging.  Thus, I found the read illuminating to no small degree.  I learned alot about the roots of punk, how it spread and rose, and the end of it.  By correctly defining the terms of the book "The Indie Years", we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years.  Once they sign with a major label, their story is ended.  This was both a good idea and frustrating one, as we see the birth and growth of bands, but not what happens to them (in most cases) once they hit a major label.  Frequently, signing with a major label creates/expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and I would have liked to have known what happened from there.  Regardless, this book is well-written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book.
