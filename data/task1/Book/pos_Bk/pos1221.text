This is an extraordinary biography for, while Blumenson's admiration for George Patton is evident, it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of Patton's personality - both positive and negative. The book truly goes  beyond the popular perception of the General -and far beyond the movie- in  exploring his character and motivations. Not an overly long book, but  thorough, detailed, and very enjoyable to read
