This is a charming little book.  It's very concise, profusely illustrated, and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids.  It delightfully summarizes the work of Plato/Theaetetus, Archimedes, Euclid, Kepler, and Euler in only 57 pages, half of which contain only illustrations.  As a model-builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra, I was a little concerned when I looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about "sacred geometry."  Fortunately (at least from my point of view) it does not contain a word about it, except for a cursory reference to the elements Plato associated with each of the Platonic Solids.  A table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge/radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids--all the info a model builder needs!  This book won't impress anyone with a mathematics background, but for a layman like me, it's a perfect introduction.  Kudos to Sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format
