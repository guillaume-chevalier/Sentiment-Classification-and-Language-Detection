This book written by Don Brown is a wonderful children's book.  In this story, set in 1870, Mary Kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to Africa. Mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. Her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. Although Mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. Mary, now an adult travels to Africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. The book tells some of her experiences in Africa. Without revealing what happens at the end, I will tell you that Mary has many experiences in this children's book. She takes the reader through her life. The illustrations in the book help the reader visualize Mary's life. This is not my favorite children's book, but I would highly recommend this book to any parent or child. It kept my interest and it is sure to keep yours
