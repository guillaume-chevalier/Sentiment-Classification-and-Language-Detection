I have never been a big fan of motivational books, because they seem so "pie in the sky" if you know what I mean. But a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different. He was right. It was easy to read and in fact I didn't want to put it down. But what I really liked was the "how to" part of the book. After all, it's no good reading about other people's success stories if you don't know how to make your own. Also, something I thought was interesting is that the author has a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder several times a day. I guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and this website doesn't let you forget. Hmmmmm . . . electronic nagging as the key to success! ;-) Hey, whatever works
