This book shows in detail how much of the media has gone out of its way to attack the President and how many facts have been distorted in the process.It also provides a rare look at what the President really does with his time and how much effort he puts into his work.If you are looking for a book that labels President Bush as a liar or a dummy, this is not the book for you.  But it is a superb look at the events of the last year and a half, including the election of 2004.Don't be narrow-minded.  I highly recommend it
