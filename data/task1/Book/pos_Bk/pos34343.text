I loved this book.  It talked about every facet of the stock market, but didn't go overboard with jargon.  I knew absolutely nothing about stocks and after reading this book I am ready to learn more.  It was well written, interesting, and, unlike some investing books, the author was not trying to sell anything.  This is the perfect book for anyone who wants to invest but has no knowledge of the subject.  I really enjoyed this book
