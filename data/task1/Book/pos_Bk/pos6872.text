This book is so great and touching. As a mixed race teen this book gave me hope and confidence. It taught me to honest and open. It made me proud to be me. Never has a book made me so convinced that I am great and wonderful  to be multiracial. I thank the author for this awesome book. Anyone who is  biracial should read this book. Not just once, but over and over, marking  the poems and stories that you can most relate to and read them when you  are feeling down on yourself. This is one &quot;must have&quot; book
