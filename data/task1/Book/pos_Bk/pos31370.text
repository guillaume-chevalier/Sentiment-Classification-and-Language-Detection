I served in the army myself and although i haven't expirienced war myself i expirienced a lot during my service in the IDF.This book takes you inside the heads and lives of the grunts who went through the hell of vietnam. The figures changes during the story and you learn more and more of them, feeling like you are walking in the jungles by them.Someone told me this was a "hard book to read" and i didn't know what he'd meant until i finished it. this is one of my favorite books and almost the only one i've read more than once.a must for anyone interested in the vietnam war
