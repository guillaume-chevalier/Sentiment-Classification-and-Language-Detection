Never Be Sick Again offers a major breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease.  I am a biochemist doing medical research at UCLA. A friend gave me this book to read, and I was very skeptical.  After reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about what it was saying.  I even lost sleep thinking about it.  After many weeks, I have come to a conclusion - the author is right.  There is only one disease and there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary!  Once you understand this simple concept, it changes everything.  If your mind is not closed to new ideas, the profound insights in this book will change your life for the better.  It will give you the power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease.  With this new understanding, from now on, I will approach my research in an entirely different way.  C.L
