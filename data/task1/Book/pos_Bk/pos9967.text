As always the latest compilation in this annual science fiction anthology remains one of the great anthologies as the current entries are top rate.  For the most part, the thirty contributions are superb tales from a who's who of the genre.  Especially fascinating is Paul McAuley's creative entry "The Two Dicks," in which Philip K. Dick writes mainstream fiction until he meets Richard Nixon.  Other stories are well written as Gardner Dozier scores again with selections that run the gamut from alternative realties to artificial intelligence to "animal" intelligence that worms its way into the reader's mind.  The introduction by Mr. Dozier provides a "Summation" of the trends in the year, which can be summarized as "stable".  Science fiction fans who appreciate shorts will devour this must reading that once again lives up to its title.Harriet Klausner
