As a frequent reader of home design books and magazines, the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me.  A quick review of the table of contents revealed that I had to have this book.  Pelosi begins with the basics, moves into specifics, and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune. The pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor. Whether you are looking for a single design solution or, like me, enjoy reading about interior design, this is the book for you...and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home.  "Interior Divine" made my holiday shopping easier this year!
