I found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research &amp; of tracking earnings estimates. Mitch Zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform. The Zacks Rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years...It seems as if the Zacks Rank really is accurate, and more imporartantly a successful investing method...This is the first book I have read that has actually helped  me make money, rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads. Overall good book, I would definitely recommend it
