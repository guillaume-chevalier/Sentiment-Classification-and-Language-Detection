Stephen King has written another attention grabber.  I read, and listened, as I have both the paperback and the audio book.  I found this book great, as it follows both the imaginary and the real sides of life.  I found that as I read the book, I really would like to visit the library that is described in the book.  This book follows down a strange path, emerging in what could almost be explained as a real story of fact in the past.  I recommend this novel, and the audio book as the narrator does a great job, it will not dissapoint as &quot;everything's eventual&quot; did, in my opinion.  Good luck and good reading!  (Note:  The audio version of this book is narrated by FRANK MULLER.  Anyone who has listened to Stephen King Audio Books has sure to have been wowwed by Frank Muller.  In this audio book recording, Frank Muller's voice is almost unrecognizable and amazing as he plays this roll.  Frank Muller and audio books are truly like movies for your mind)
