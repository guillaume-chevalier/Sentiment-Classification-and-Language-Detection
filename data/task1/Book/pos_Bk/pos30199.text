As a social work psychotherapist, I recommend this book highly and with great confidence. I have a number of people I see individually or via phone consultation and have recommended they purchase this book as adjunct to the work we do together. Peter understands and explains well the relationship between our emotional attachments and the "thhings" we collect. Great insight and recommended
