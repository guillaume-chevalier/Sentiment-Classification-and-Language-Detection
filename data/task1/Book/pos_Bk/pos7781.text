I bought this book in lieu of the 2005 Guiness Book of World Records, and I don't regret the decision at all. This is a huge book- 250 pages- with thousands of interesting and bizzare tidbits in categories such as "Amazing Earth", "Body and Mind", "Wonders of Science", "Fun and Games", and "Beyond Belief". I had never watched the Ripley's show or read any other Ripley's books before. The facts are just as fascinating as in Guiness, but they are presented in a more fun, colorful, and kid- friendly way.This would make a great present for any kid (or grown- up kid), even for those who don't read much.The editing isn't the greatest, and I found one fact that is repeated twice in two different sections (see if you can catch it!) but I still give it a full 5 stars!And... the cover makes me kind of dizzy, but that's okay. ;-
