A mind-opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from, this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in psychology. (Although I'm not giving up the meds just yet). I'm amazed by how clearly Yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have. The case histories he describes are priceless.  On the &quot;negative&quot; side, Yapko can be just a bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the only way. And although he mentions other theories of depression, he favors the &quot;nurture&quot; theory of ineffective learned thought patterns, claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (Maybe next lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;)  Yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people &quot;depressives,&quot; which is the kind of labeling we could do without.   The most serious criticism I have is that his &quot;Learn by Doing&quot; exercises are sometimes impractical, if not downright silly. For example, to learn about perceived control, Yapko writes, &quot;spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission to do everything, such as 'Can I go to the bathroom?'&quot;. (Can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day?) Other exercises tell you to &quot;interview at least a dozen people&quot; or &quot;sometime when you feel playful, experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things&quot; like flying. What depressed person feels playful? Many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing, and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those of us who are &quot;older&quot; and have physical disabilities. However, I do plan to complete the written exercises.   Having outlined these minor drawbacks, I have to say it's an excellent book--after all these years, I finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression.
