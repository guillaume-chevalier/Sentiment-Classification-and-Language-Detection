Ellen Wright has done it again.  This time, with Meredith Brokaw.  And the two have combined to put together a wonderful array of recipes that are easy to follow and wonderful to serve to guests.  Often at my dinner parties I refer to Ellen Wright's previous books.  But now Big Sky opens a new door to cooking and presents inviting and simple recipes that will have your guests in awe of your skills.  Even for simple family meals, you will find yourself referring to Big Sky time and time again... I don't know what I did before Big Sky was published.  This is a five-star cookbook that everyone should have in their home.
