It took cancer to wake me up.  I now do everything I can to inform my family and friends of the of the importance of a health lifestyle and eating habits.  This author also wrote "What you don't know may be killing you"  These two books are great to accidently leave at a loved ones home.  They are filled with tons of improtant messages and very easy to relate to examples are given that help you understand what actually is happening to your body. My dad has gone from drinking no water to probably half of what he needs but this is a start, he will read more the next time I leave another book by accident...  This author is great!
