This was my very first book for Nora Roberts, and so far it's the best book EVER.  It is THE PERFECT book.  Brianna is a wonderful, smart inn keeper with many talents and a rare kind of maturity.  I would love to be like her!  And Gray is a successful, sweet, caring, witty author that comes to her inn in Ireland to relax and start a new book.  This is no ordinary romance.  I love that it goes deep, not only into the main characters' personalities, but there is also Brianna's sister and brother-in-law, her mother, her friend, and Gray's agent.  Not to mention the wonderful scenary of Ireland described throughout the book.  The conlcusion of the book is wonderful and utterly satisfying, leaving you with a happy glow that lasts a long time!  Other books by Nora Roberts are good, but this one takes the prize.  Of the Born trilogy this one is the best and it should NOT be missed
