One star is too generous!  AAARRRGGGH!  I am still mad about this book and I read it 3 books ago!  I loved Ted Dekker's "Three" and I enjoyed Peretti's children's books I read with my kiddos, so I was looking forward to the arrival of a collaboration.  But it was utterly silly!  If I start a book, I have to finish it.  Okay, that's my own fault, but I had to MAKE myself read this to get it over with!  I wanted to burn the book when I was finished to make sure nobody else I knew ever read my copy.  The ending?  Well, "Shoo!  Get out of here!"  was embarrassing!  Shame on you, Frank and Ted
