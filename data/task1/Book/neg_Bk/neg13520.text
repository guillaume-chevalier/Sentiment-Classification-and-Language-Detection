I can't give this book more than two stars, and that's being generous. Mr. Hall does present some interesting ideas, but unfortunately, his editors have done him a huge disservice. Here are the first three sentences of Stage I, on page 23; Essentially what we have now--nanoscale science and technology--including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes, and a very limited ability to manipulate, that is, by pushing things around with the same scanning probes. A scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick. Because you have a computer behind it, you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture.I made it through the first fifty pages, and it didn't get any better.  I don't know if Mr. Hall had a final read before publication, or not, but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited.
