This is just another attack by organized medicine on Alternative treatments and therapies, in particular chiropractic. Dr. Rosenfeld comes across as biased, ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides. His assertion that he "loves chiropractors is disingenous at best." He prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe (toxic) drugs. He lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare, occuring one in many millions, and suggests that these are common occurances. He fails to mention that the practice of (Allopathic) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in The United States, which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called "Alternatives". If you want good advice, start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors, especially this one!!
