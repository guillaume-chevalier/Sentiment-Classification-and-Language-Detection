I'm very disappointed in this book, although some information IN it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. It is an excellent Textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular  basis and find ideas for what you need. Although broken into sections, they  are not readily found or visible. One must search the information needed as  in a research assignment. The reproducibles are MAINLY for elementary  grades. This was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's  contents, on-line. Although the price was reasonable, I'm not pleased with  the way the book is organized &amp; printed
