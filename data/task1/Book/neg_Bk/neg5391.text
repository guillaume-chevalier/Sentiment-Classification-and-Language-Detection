Even if somehow Bin Laden did pick up this book and for some reason decide to read it he would not stick with it to learn the lesson that his victims are real average struggling people.  The fictional letter/diary to Bin Laden from the mother of a fictional attack victim from an Arsenal-Chelsea soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring Bin Laden would give it away before learning what the author wants him to.  The mother just waffles on and on and on and on and on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in any paragraph.  If Bin Laden is ever captured maybe force him to read this as torture or something.  Also why does Chris Cleve chose to glorify Bin Ladden by crediting him with a new attack when lets face it he hasn't achieved much since September 11 2001 other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave somewhere.  This book would have been more realistic and made more sense as a letter to the IRA, Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad or one of the current more frequently operating groups. Alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional character on one of the planes or in the World trade Centre.  A good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank, extremely boring!
