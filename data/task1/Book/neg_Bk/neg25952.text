I admit that I tried to read this twice and failed both times.  I got to around page 20 or so.  I'll probably try again.  However, if you're an adult who has already read other philosophies I would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll know what Objectivism is about.  I wouldn't suggest it for teens that haven't had any prior readings, though.  Objectivism is about the self and about "reason", and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else. The strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous.  I assume that's in my head, but judge for yourself.  Her caricatures of "The Witch Doctor" (who controls others from a spiritual perspective) and "Attila" (who controls by brute force) are actually interesting.  Wrong, but interesting.  Since Objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think they do, anyway), it's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book.My suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on everything), or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills. Judging by previous reviews, it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers.If you buy into it, you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way.  If you don't buy into it, however, you're evil (either the Witch Doctor or Attila) and probably just too stupid to "get it".  Why I didn't finish it yet...I just couldn't get past her ignorance of history, frankly.   If you're writing a work of fiction, the historical innacuracies don't matter, but this isn't supposed to be fiction.  I like history and most people don't, so it probably won't bother most people. Also, while she denounces religion, Ms. Rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself.  Like all other religions and cults, the world is messed up basically because people don't think like she does.
