The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired.  The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents.  Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to.  The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book.  You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused.  If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher
