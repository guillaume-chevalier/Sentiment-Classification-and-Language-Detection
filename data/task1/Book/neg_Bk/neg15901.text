I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o
