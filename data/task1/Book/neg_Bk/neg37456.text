Let's make this clear... I won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. So this is going to be short and sweet!  This book is a glorified magazine.  Worth $14.95 - tops.  The pitfalls of bookbuying online, I guess.  You never know what you are going to get.  Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared.  The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared.  The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films.  Throughout the book the author treats these two as the &quot;Coke and Pepsi&quot; of infrared films.  I'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same
