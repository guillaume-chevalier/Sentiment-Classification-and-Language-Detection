A little outdated, quite a few beers here aren't made anymore. Beer reviews are always personal opinion, and you'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy doesn't know what hes talking about. I'd ignore what they say, everybody has their own preference.Think about this before you buy this book:1) Why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers?2) its very out dated... 5 years is a long time
