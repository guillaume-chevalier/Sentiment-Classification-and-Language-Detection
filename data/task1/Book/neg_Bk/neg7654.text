At least this author mentions the "mockery" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to "fog" the public. The "real issue" of whether Martha/Mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question "DID MARTHA STEWART" lie, demonstrates some complacency. Is it this complacency Martha/Mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? Is it the "greyness" of white-collar crime that Martha/Mdiddy was trying to play on? Is society the ultimate judge about a person's guilt or innocence? If so, what has Martha/Mdiddy been judged?Be "thoughtful"~Shaw
