I think its not wise to refer to only one source here is one of the testmonies:"I was born in Israel (Palestine then) to a well-known Jewish religious family. We are living in Israel for many generations; well before the Zionists infiltrated the Middle East. Jews and Moslems always lived in peace in Palestine until the Zionists came from Europe, massacred the Palestinians (Dir Yassin, etc.) and forced them to run away from their lands and get locked into the refugee camps across the borders for almost three generations. Studying in a Jewish religious school in Tel Aviv, I was taught that the 'bad Arabs' conducted pogroms all over Palestine killing Jews. My family told me the opposite: we lived in Palestine in peace for generations with our Moslem brothers. When the Zionists started their pogroms (Dir Yassin), the Moslem acted in revenge and started their own pogroms, killing Jews. However, our Moslem friends actually saved the lives of our family by hiding us in their own houses at a risk to their own lives.
