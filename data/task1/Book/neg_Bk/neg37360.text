This book is awful.  I have read the entire thing, and it says nothing that is useful.  I have been in public accounting for 10 years, and i am now ready to start my own firm.  I wasted my money on buying this book.  I know it is tempting to buy, since the title is exactly what i was looking for, but trust me, choose another book.  The accounting Guild website that the author constantly refers to is no longer in existence
