I purchased this book at Walmart, which rarely carries books regarding Shambala or any other Eastern ideology. It was cheap and on the clearance rack. I should have know better.When I realized this was part three in a series I decided to read the first two books, The Celestine Prophecy and The Tenth Insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one. After borrowing and reading the first two, I realized what a sham this series truly is. First, I realize they are supposed to be fictional. However, when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise, the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate. Additionally, when usurping a mythical name such as Shambala, one should know what the actual mythology entails, instead of making up one's own notion of what is involed.  Shambala is NOT the same as Shangri-la. Shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century Western culture. Shambala is an ancient Eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in Redfield's imagination.Also, beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies. As Joseph Campbell said many times in his lectures and books, they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures, but they must never be mixed together. It just doesn't work
