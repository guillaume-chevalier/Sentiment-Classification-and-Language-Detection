I bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me. However, the information provided is too extensive and confusing, listing far too many "points" in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them. The body map listing them is in the first part of the book, so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to. I also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous. The way this system originated is also a little murky. This is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public
