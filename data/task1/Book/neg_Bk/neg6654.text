The content is excellent.  The digital format is largely useless.I bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition.  But, the digital rights management restrictions mean that I can't print selected pages to stick in a folder, read on the train, or scribble notes on.  I can't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic 'notes' file.  The onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one
