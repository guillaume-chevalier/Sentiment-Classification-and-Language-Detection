This is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.  I was expecting some new information about a "secret language".  There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the "secret"?I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip.  The author says that cats do not get lonely.  Well, that's wrong.  He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served.  How does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?  The title was deceiving
