Why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker.  I can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book.The wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous.  You can go whole paragraphs without coming upon anything worth knowing.I can only hope that the actual CISA exam questions are not written as poorly as the sample questions within this book.If you value your time, do not buy this book
