I had to read this book for a political theory class in college.  After talking with several other members I was happy to find out that I do not have the reading skills of a third grader...Benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with.  The book is also not organized well.  In order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes.  Points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book.  Benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued.  Throughout much of the book Benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of John Rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights.  To be honest, I disagree with her views and admit that I might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if I agreed with her.  Still, I do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically.  Much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.  In short, I do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure, or intellectual curiosity.  If you have to read The Rights of Others for a class, I extend my condolences.
