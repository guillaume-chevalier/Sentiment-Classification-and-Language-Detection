Just know this book has you developing code in the SDK, not Visual Studio .NET.  If anything that should turn you away from buying this.  Any .NET programmer WILL be working with Visual Studio and not an SDK.  The SAMS teach yourself C# in 24 hours was completely written for VS .NET, so I am confused as to why this book was not.Get another book as this one will be only of use for terminology and OOP theory.  It was a waste on Money for me.
