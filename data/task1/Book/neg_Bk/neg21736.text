I couldn't finish this book after readng "Fairytale."  Misfit insecure Caucasian male falls for Asian stripper/prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets.  I thought possibly this story reveals a lot about Olen Butler.  He wrote about this relationship with such relish, he sounds to me like a P.C. Caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the "otherness" of Asian people and doesn't see them for what they are, just wants them to appreciate big strong white man.  I thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother.  So she was not honest with him.  But Olen Butler wrote about her as if this stripper/pros. was wonderful, the kind of wife any man would want.  I shook my head and thought, "You have issues."  Probably if she were Caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something.  After this the other stories just did not appeal to me
