 Ed Klein is really so desperate in his attack that he can't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against Hillary!    What a lot of misinformation and outright lies. To actually accuse Marian Wright Edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal, and to insinuate that Chelsea was the result of a rape, even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant, is disgusting.    I should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were Monica Lewinsky!
