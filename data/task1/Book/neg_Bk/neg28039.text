As a beef eating Hindu I am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for Hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat. I browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing.First, it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes. It clearly had a bias which turned me off.Second, I am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book. There were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers ("the government of India demands be ritually burned").Later I searched on google with the book title and words "ban", "government of India" and found no news reports relating any government of India attempts at banning this book. There were no reports on ban by Allahabad High Court either. All I found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions. Third, I found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions.It basically left me disappointed and I am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter.
