Here's a real-review:*The first 100 pages are about how her mother made her get a nose job that when wrong.*The second 100 pages are about the Frankenstein movie.*The last 90 pages are about every movie-star that's ever gotten cosmetic surgery.And the whole thing is stitched together with an English teacher's weekend theory on how a mix of "Simulations and Simulacra" + "The Ego and the Id" explain why people get cosmetic surgery.  If you're someone who orders books online based on catchy titles, then do yourself a favor and skip this one.  How can a book on cosmetic surgery not even talk about the golden ratio?
