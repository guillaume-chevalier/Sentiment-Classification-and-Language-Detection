A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book!  I wanted to strangle him!  Repetitive, condescending, overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring!!!  Here is the nuts of it all:  Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask.  Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away.  Everything else is simply preamble... over and over and over.  Hope I saved you 20 bucks
