Oh dear. This is another book like the horrible "Who Moved My Cheese?" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children.Like the aforementioned "Who thinks my cheese stinks?" (or whatever it is called), I saw some people in the organisation where I work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days.It's all about making work "FUN". Yep, work can be "FUN". Tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. Or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases.Of course, it's just great "FUN" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids.Because that's what work is - "FUN" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers.Of course in the examples I have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be "FUN".Myself, I do have some "FUN" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us.You can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb "Fish"-style "WORK MUST BE FUN" philosophy. I'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable.As to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace "FUN" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise.First immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as "FUN".Second, let them know that they now "CHOOSE" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are "LETTING THE TEAM DOWN" and not complying with the obligation to "MAKE WORK FUN".Third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the "WORK IS FUN" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of FISH, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not HAVING FUN AT WORK and use the Enron-style message that they "just don't get it".In this way, the resistant individual can be said to be "incompatible with our mission and values", "bad for morale" or just "out of step".In this way, the "FUN-LOVING" workers, who have now taken on the costume of "FORCED FALSE FUN" can be set against them.Of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign.This book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their "WORK IS FUN".Just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously.They might tell you to stick your "FISH" where the sun doesn't shine
