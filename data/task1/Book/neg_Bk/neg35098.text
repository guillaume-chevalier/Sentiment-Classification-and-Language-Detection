Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.  Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.* Recently reprinted and highly recommended!
