I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between &quot;wicca&quot; and &quot;witchcraft&quot;.  Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to &quot;chopping&quot; of source materials. This is a waste of money
