Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, &quot;Yeah! yeah! That's me!&quot; and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, &quot;No duh!&quot; I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. &quot;Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!&quot; Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading &quot;Knowing God&quot; by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him
