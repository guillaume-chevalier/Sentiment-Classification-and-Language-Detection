I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. Although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail; it just doesn't click for me. I f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline. Surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but I just cannot do it my self
