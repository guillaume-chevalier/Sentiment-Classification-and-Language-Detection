This book refers to philosophical basis of Buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion. It is not a manual nor a guide. No Meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book. the style is simbolic and poetical. it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content. It will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work
