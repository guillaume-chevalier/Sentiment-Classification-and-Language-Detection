If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student
