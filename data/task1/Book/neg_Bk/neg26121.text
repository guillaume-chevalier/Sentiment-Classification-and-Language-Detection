When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now.Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that?So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you
