Surely I'm not the only one who found this book totally [bad].  The only thing it made me wonder about is how it's possible to write such a thorougly BORING book about such fascinating women.  The writing is just dull and full of the author's biases and prejudices, which just aren't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves.  It's written in that old-school feminism (negative, no fun) tone that thank God feminism has since moved beyond.  My advice:  find another book about women mystics not filtered through Flinder's lens
