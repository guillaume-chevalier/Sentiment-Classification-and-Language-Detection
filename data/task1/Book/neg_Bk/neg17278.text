I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning. French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more.
