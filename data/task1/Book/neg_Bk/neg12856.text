This book started well, but fell flat in the middle. What little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. Even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly.Well, I didn't bother to finish it--I have limited time for reading, and I don't like to waste it.
