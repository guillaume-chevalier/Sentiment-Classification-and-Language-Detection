There was nothing in this book that our association hasn't covered nearly every week.  I was very dissapointed.  It offered little tidbits like &quot;a postgame review can help you learn from experience&quot;.  Don't we ALL do &quot;postgame reviews&quot;, even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home?  I certainly do.  No, I'm not he best umpire in our association.  I would rate myself as somewhere in the middle.  The book offered me nothing new, nothing that our association doesn't talk about constantly.  Buy a Childress, or save your money
