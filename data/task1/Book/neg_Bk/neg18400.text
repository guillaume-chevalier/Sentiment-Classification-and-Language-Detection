I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least.
