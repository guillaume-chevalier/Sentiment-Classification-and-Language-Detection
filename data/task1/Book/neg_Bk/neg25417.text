I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.
