A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life. In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books
