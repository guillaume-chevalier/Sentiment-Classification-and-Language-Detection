i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but....some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however
