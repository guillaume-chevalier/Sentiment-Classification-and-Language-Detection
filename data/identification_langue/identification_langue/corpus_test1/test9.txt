By choosing a used car instead of new, you can save some money. A new car depreciates fast, especially in the first few years. After 3-4 years, a car is worth only about 60-70% of its original price. As soon as a just-sold new vehicle drives out of the dealership, it drops a thousand or two in value as it suddenly becomes a used car.
