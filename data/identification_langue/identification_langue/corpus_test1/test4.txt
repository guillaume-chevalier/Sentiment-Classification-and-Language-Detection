Bigger and better smartphones, a potential game-changing wearable and a sequel to one of the best tablets yet. That's what seems to be on tap for Apple's big Sept. 9 event. But that's not all we expect from Tim Cook & Co. Here's a rundown of all of the latest rumors for you to digest heading into what is shaping up to be a huge day in Cupertino, California.

Sick of all the leaks and speculation? Don't worry, Tom's Guide and Tom's Hardware will be at Apple's event to bring you highlights, analysis and hands-on goodness.

The worst kept smartphone secrets will soon see the light of day. The iPhone 6 is expected to come in two sizes -- 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches -- both a sizable increase from today's puny 4 inches. The display could be made of super-strong sapphire crystal, which we've seen shrug off scratches and even a knife stabbing in leaked videos.

The iPhone 6 is also expected to pack a faster new A8 processor running at 2 GHz. That would be quite a speed bump from the current 1.3-GHz A7 chip in the iPhone 5s. An NFC chip will apparently allow the iPhone 6 to make mobile payments and easily pair with the iWatch. Also expect a more enhanced camera, possibly with 10-MP resolution. The ability to swap lenses could also be in the cards.
