I looked for an introduction to the basics of Office automation and bought this book.  Every example code I tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial.  Samples from the MSDN was just as good as this book.If you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there, this book is OK.  But for any real programming it is not very useful.
