I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge  fan.Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed.  Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement
