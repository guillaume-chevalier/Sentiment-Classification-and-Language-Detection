Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships
