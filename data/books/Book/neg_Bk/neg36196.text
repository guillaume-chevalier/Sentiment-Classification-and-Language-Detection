After reading all the author's books so far, i realized he is repeating himself. In all his books (including the ones which Myron Bolitar isn't present) there are the same elements in the plot: disappeared person who might or not be dead, mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot, the hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved "in the last minute", someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot but no one knows for sure. As the plots became being built upon the same structure, the suprise is getting less and less after each book.  Being someone who started liking mistery books after reading all Agatha Christie's ones, and because each book of hers is completely diferent from the other, i look for the same originality in other mistery books.Of course the book is good for a first time Harlan Coben reader. I just didn't like it that much because of the repetitions, which make very easy to guess the final, spoiling the suspense of the reading
