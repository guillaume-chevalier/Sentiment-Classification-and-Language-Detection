I bought this book before my first trip to Austria. I had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations. That turned out to betrue. What shall we do with a paragraph that tells us thatAustrian women are strong-minded and independent and organize their homelife well, although many go to work?This book might have some value for a person who had neverleft their english-speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the saunaor at the beach. It also provides some amusing anecdotesabout language (especially viennese) and useful info about festivals.Mostly, though this book was good for reading aloud toAustrian friends. I would quote it as an iron-clad authority when their behavior didn't quite match the book's version and thereby amused them tremendously.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN978160164000
