I ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions.  I'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools.  Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  I'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.  Some of the parenting tips are common sense that I didn't think needed to be reiterated.  A person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  I was looking for more than that.  The advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process.There is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  An example is always attributing "hovering parents" to ego issues, that a parent "needs to be needed".  Some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  False assumptions leads to false conclusions.  I gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  But it isn't helping my family.
