I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy.This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you
