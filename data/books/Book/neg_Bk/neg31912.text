I quote from GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL, p. 215: "...after spending a half hour with that book, GODS' MAN. I called [a nun, six years my senior, who has been my spiritual director for more than twenty-five years] sobbing with a complex of emotions, including hatred for the author, disgust at the book, rage at its destructiveness, sorrow for all the other young boys and girls who had been the book's victims, and a feeling of deep contamination that I had received just from looking at it. After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years." Undoubtedly, Dr. Peck's strong emotional reaction was due to the destruction the book wrought in the life of one of Peck's patients. But now you are forewarned
