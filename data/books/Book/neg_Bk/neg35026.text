Melrose Larry Green's book is full of quotes.  Quotes and information used to back up points are good things.  He appears to have researched by surfing the Internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others.  This is all fine and acceptable.The problem with "Why the Clintons Belong in Prison" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.  His points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit.  With a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a "hit and run" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.
