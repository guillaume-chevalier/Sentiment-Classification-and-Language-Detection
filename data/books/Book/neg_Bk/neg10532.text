This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed. Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book
