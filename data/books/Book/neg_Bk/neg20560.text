The topic of this book is very interesting: espionage in the Revolutionary War. Unfortunately, "Washington's Spies" goes into so much nit-picking detail that, as the cliche goes, you can't see the forest for the trees. To really get anything out of this book, you'd have to be a *very* dedicated Revolutionary War buff. It didn't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader.
