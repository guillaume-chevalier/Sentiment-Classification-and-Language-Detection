This book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all. You could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did. Book doesnt SHOW you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them. It also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses. It is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used.
