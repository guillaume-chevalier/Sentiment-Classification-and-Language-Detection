I'm really disappointed in this book, because the author seems to imply that you can have ANYTHING you want, but that is just not the case.  It's a deceptive title.  I can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you; you're better off practising Feng Shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book (and I'm not knocking Feng Shui, I practise it myself).  People like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense.  In the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the "next big thing" to promise you some more snake oil.Another fact I'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in CD format for around $60.00 (I got a flyer in the mail).  If he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called "secrets," doesn't that go against his own moral values?  One of the gimmicks of the CDs is that you can learn the secret sound of "creation," as if chanting "Ahhhh" is going to make everything alright.  Thanks to Dyer and others like him, I am completely against any sort of "positive thinking" Guru.  They are only after YOUR money (while you keep wishing you had more).*Btw, you might be interested to know that after reading this book, you're only going to find out that the BIG CATCH is that Manifesting Your Destiny, according to the author, ONLY applies to spiritual matters.  Huh?  Yes.  The entire book promises you can have anything you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity.  The author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with "God's" plan, you don't have a chance either.  Thought I'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated!
