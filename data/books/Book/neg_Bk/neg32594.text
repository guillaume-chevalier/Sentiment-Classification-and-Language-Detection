i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  Halo is an awesome game but it's REALLY not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete MORON not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying Cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses
