If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his &quot;Official Religious Disclaimer&quot; at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading
