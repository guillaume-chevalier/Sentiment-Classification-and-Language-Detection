Seven Times The Sun is not for everyone. It could be a springboard, offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life. But the songs, poems and traditions offered in Shea Darian's book are hokey and contrived at best, cumbersome and artificial at worst. None of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book. Darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent. True, parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have. But I'm just thankful Amazon has a customer-friendly return policy
