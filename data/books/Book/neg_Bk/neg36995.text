I'm a Zone diet believer - but this book is a serious letdown.  Two major problems with this worthless book:1. Almost all of the recipes involve *far* too much preparation - the title is *very* misleading.2. I find it hard to believe that anyone actually prepared these recipes, and thought they were *good*!  Most of the meals are horrible due to the *huge* proportion of vegetables.  I mean, an omelet with over 3 cups of asparagus??
