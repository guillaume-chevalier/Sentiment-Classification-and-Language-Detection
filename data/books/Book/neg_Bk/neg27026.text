Don't bother buying 'the wonder of girls,borrow it from a friend cause it will only make a turn around the office with many a snicker.I couldn't think of a girl I grew up with including myself who needed constant reassurance or had more trouble with math than boys.I agree with the other review about we grow our own brains and make connections.Infact,research shows if you give any child a chance at spatial tasks,the childimproves.Girls often are given dolls .,so how can a girl develope spatial ability playing with a doll? Go fig!Gurian doesn't tell the reader anything about experience and environment ~ instead he is vocal about fixed brain function which of course leaves a child in a narrow subgroup.Girls are all lumped into one.I wouldn't let your daughter read this book,'it might give her a bad case of low self~esteem and leave her wondering about herself as a woman.Gurian wants women in second place at best.Teach your daughter to believe in herself not some pop psychology from a questionable author bent on messing with her success
