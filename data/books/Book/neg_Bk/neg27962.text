I've been following BPRD since the very beginning and feel that I can say with all sincerity, that this series gets better and better with each new story!  The TPB's are absolutely the way to go if you don't frequent comic stores (which I do).  So do yourself a favor and purchase all of the TPB's, kick back in an easy chair with a stock of time set aside, and enjoy these bad boys to your hearts content
