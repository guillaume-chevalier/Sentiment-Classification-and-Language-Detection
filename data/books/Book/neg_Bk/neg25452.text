I dont take neither stance on Religion nor Science with these comments.I have read the book and I have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly. It has one goal... Sell, sell, sell.If you are after useful, quality, informative, knowledge to gain... well you wont find it here. Im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says "non-fiction".The author is a talented story teller...... add a few statistics here and there, a dash of scientific key figures, mix it with life's controversial unsolved mysteries, a few more dash of historic events and famous people, add and link a few references here and there, and WALA!!!! you have a best seller.Isnt that ironic! it is a "New York Times number 1 best seller" It was an interesting read though.
