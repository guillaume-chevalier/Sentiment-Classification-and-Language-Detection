Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night?Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money
