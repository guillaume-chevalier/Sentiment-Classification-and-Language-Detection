This book started off very good, but as I read on the reading became ardious.  I found it hard work to finish this book.  I don't know why I had such a hard time enjoying the book while all the other reviewser thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, but I would read another shark book, such as Shark Trouble or Close to Shore rather than waste my time on this book
