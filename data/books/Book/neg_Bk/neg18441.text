I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst
