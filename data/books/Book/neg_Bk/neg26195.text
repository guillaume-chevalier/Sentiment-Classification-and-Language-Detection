18 Jun 2005As the book progressed, it got more and more egoistic, to the point where it becomes a turn-off towards the end of the book. I am surprised that there was so little mentioned of Hakeem. Shaq's attitude seems to be that since he can score, he does not respect centers who can't score. Whereas he respect Bill Russell. But he does give Kobe his fair share of spotlight. The other book I read was an unabashed hype of Shaq, so this is a big improvement.
