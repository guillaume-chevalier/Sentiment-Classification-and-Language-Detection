This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased
