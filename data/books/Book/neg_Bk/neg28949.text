I admittedly have not completed the full book, as it is thick.  However I do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for DFSS.  For example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems.  I therefore think the book is more about Six Sigma than DFSS.Barry
