Alexander Pope was not of the Romantic period, and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a GRE Subject Test.  This alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions, asks for identification of the most obscure passages, and frequently explains why B was the right answer, and why A, C, and D were wrong, but leaves that status of E wholly to the realm of mystery.  The practice test sent out with the GRE registration is different in scope, clarity, and difficulty.  I actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration.  Don't buy this book.  Don't even steal it.  Spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it
