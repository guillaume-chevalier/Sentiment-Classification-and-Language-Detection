You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional &quot;white&quot; depiction of the world
