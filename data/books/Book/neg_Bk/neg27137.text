I haven't done this in awhile, but I don't think I could review this piece any better than the other reviews I've read about it. It's pretty average, however filled with nice bits of knowledge. They didn't seem well-researched in some areas. Here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other "critics" that I agree with..."they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences...would be enough." - John Gallant"Biased against superheros(sic)" - Christopher Ritter"I found this book to be tedious, lacking in charm, badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas." - C.P. Halliday"I picked up this book." - Lawrance M. Bernabo"Their belief seems to be that Donald Duck was the best comic book ever..." - M.G. Bloedorn"Pretty boring." - BernardZ"...a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities." - Peter Vinton Jr."...this book will not satisfy full on fans..." - James N. Simpson &lt;---gave it five stars."a chance to laugh about the heroes I still love and that mean so much to me." - Reviewer"Man, there's a whole 200 pages of this pooh-poohing, cranky-old-maid kind of stuff!" - Mark Alfred"They were even putting words into C. Darwin's mouth." - Aaron Spriggs"Mildly entertaining but not great" - Reviewer"When the man (Dean Koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he doesn't read comics, I began to get worried." - Ivan A. Wolfe"I agree with an earlier poster." - Reviewer"Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible." Plastic Larry"the authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin for the Hulk, involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification." - J. Draper Carlson"this book is not mean spirited or nasty." Reviewer"Superman's powers break the laws of science. Ooh. Stop the presses." - [...]"interesting." - Rick Hunter"The Science of Superheroes," - Reviewer
