Surely there's more to chinese youth culture than descriptions of affairs with tall western men. Being a fan of Pearl Buck's books on China, I was looking for more contemporary accounts of chinese culture. But this book was so dissapointing.A "goodlooking" shangaiese woman gives vacuous details of her affair with a tall german man. While her doped impotent chinese boyfriend simple wastes away (why was he even in the story?)The writing is totaly lacking in any kind of talent. "I was willing to assume her glow was due to her romance than her shiseido face cream ...". Need I say more?If you want to read an account of a totally self absorbed woman infatuted with caucasian men, indulging in meaningless affairs, which probably boosts her self esteem, read this. But there's nothing worthy about China or chinese culture in this.
