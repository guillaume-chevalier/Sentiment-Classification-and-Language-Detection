I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field
