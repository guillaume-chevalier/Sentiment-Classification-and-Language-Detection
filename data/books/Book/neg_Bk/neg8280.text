I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.  The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly
