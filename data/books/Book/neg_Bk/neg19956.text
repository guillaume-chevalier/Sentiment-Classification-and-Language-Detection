This is definitely NOT one of my favorite books about stocks.  The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year.  I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know. Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.  Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  This is not something that I use or will use in my trading. Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter
