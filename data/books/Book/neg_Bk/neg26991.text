i'vc had this book since i was 7 years old. i loved the awesome photos of echanis doing his thing. if you like the elaborate and complex, then this is the knife fighting book for you. there are simpler ways of "getting it done", but few are more fun to try. and, by the way, if any of you are curious as to how he died, he was killed while "training" in nicaragua. hmmm . .
