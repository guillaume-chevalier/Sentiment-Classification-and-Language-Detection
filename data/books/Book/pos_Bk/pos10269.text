I would agree with the translator that Imitation of Christ ranks very close to the Bible. I read it over and over. It is shocking clear and concise. It forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim, yes, to be a saint.Thomas a Kempis's words cut to the heart and ring true over and over. In the normal state of human depravity, deception, duplicity, relativism, and excuse-making no one could write such a book without a transcendant, almighty, omniscient, omnipresent and infinitely merciful Lord.Each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our Lord more and more.I wait patiently for your return Lord Jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth
