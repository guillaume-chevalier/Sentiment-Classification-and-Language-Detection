This book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers.  If you've read Ernest Jones, Percy Boomer, or Jimmy Ballard (for example) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing, try "The Keys ...": You will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game.  My swing improved markedly after I came to understand author McTeigue's "lighthouse turn" (Lesson Two: Momentum).
