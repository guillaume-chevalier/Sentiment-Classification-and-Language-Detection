Definitely a wonderful book. For those following the teachings of the other books, this book provides more useful information. The path that Castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views (read the other reviews). I found it useful to read and judge for myself. What Castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon, thus the angry reviews of those  calling Castaneda a fraud due to their own failure.  Its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own 'specialness' jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains, making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it.Definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification.  Also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book.I believe Castaneda's genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated. I am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom
