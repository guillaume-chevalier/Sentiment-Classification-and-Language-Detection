This is a straightforward description of reading and writing the Arabic script.  If you have no experience with Arabic I think you would still need to locate a teacher or native speaker as some of the letters are very difficult to pronounce as native English speakers.However for the most part its easy to follow and would give you a great start, especially before you take an Arabic course.If it came with a cassette with pronouciation I would have given it 5 stars
