Almost everyone you meet is having trouble with a relationship, this book by Charles Swindoll is a wonderful tool to assist people to build better relationships.From my own person experience I have come to conclude that the larger part of relationship problems are caused by lack of communacation.In this book Charles talks about how to be open in a relationship and the value of trust not only in a personal relationship but also in the Church. A wonderful must read
