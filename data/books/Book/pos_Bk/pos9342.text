I was shocked to open this book and find the author's words targeting the very soul of my writing. It is a book about craft, not a pop culture &quot;I wanna write a book&quot; manual.Gerard shows a great understanding of the motivation behind the need and desire to write well. He speaks to those who are willing to put effort and excellence where their pen meets the page.I heartily recommend this book
