I've always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate, and that rate has sped up since I'm now a Romance Coach.  But somehow I had missed Susan Page's "If I'm So Wonderful, Why am I Still Single?" even though it has been out since 1998, the last year I was single myself.  Where have I been, and why hadn't I seen this book?Susan Page writes for "involuntary singles" -- straight, gay, male or female, each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't.  Relentlessly positive, she starts off right to the point with "So why are you still single anyway?"  And then, just when we've gotten over that shock, she states flatly:"Whatever your reasons are for being single, if you want to be in a relationship, no reason is good enough."  Then Page goes about tearing apart every good reason we've ever come up with to keep ourselves single.Here's what Page takes on and turns around: Ambivalence (my favorite), those "Dreadful Statistics," the myth of "There are no good ways to meet people," and having and keeping high standards.  Then she works on developing skills in what she calls "Frog kissing":  Learning to say no, how to recognize true intimacy, avoiding "commitmentphobes," handling the intimacy gap, and learning to say "yes."  And in the last section, "Keeping It All Together While You Look," Page tells you just how to do all that.  This is easily the best, most thorough, rounded and positive book about relationships and dating I have seen.  If you are one of Page's "involuntary singles," this book needs to be in your library.  Five chocolate dipped strawberries for Susan Page!  This is quite a book.
