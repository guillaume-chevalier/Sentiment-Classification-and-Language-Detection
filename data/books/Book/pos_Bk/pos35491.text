The author gave many thorough and enlightening illustrations on how communication breaks down &amp; what to look out for. After reading &amp; self-examination, one could identify the areas for  improvement &amp; learn  from the methods prescribed. The first part identifies the types of  relationships within the family. The second on developing God-honouring  relationships, dwelling mainly on the subject of communication. I was very  much enlightened by the types of circuit jammers within the family. Part  three expounds on sustaining Godly family relationships. It explains why  families fight &amp; how to turn discord to concord. I am very much  encouraged &amp; edified from the reading of this book
