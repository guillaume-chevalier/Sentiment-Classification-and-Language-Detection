Started out a bit slow and built into a real action packed thriller.  Several times I found myself saying, "Oh Yuk!"  Nevertheless the story line was fabulously interesting and you'll fall in love especially with Thomas, a down syndrome young man with a special gift.  This is another great story by Koontz.
