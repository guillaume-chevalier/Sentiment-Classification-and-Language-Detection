This book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a Christian, which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace.  So much of the Christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite.  We see more often the Christian faith portrayed as a religious form, political arm, and unloving attitude.  This book is a real insight into the Christian faith  of how to be a true follower of Christ who cared so much about individuals, especially those who were not self righteous, but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives.
