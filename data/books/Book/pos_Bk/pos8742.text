Playstation and X-box have nothing over the toy of the future: a time-travel device which allows for visits to the past. There's only one problem with Theo's enjoyment of the latest model: it appears to be defective, and his interactions with peoples of the past increasingly holds dangers of changing the future. The debut titles in the newe "Jump-Man Rule" series by James Valentine, Don't Touch Anything provides quick action and unpredictable twists of plot, including romance, making it a most unusual, satisfying adventure story recommended for ages 8-12.
