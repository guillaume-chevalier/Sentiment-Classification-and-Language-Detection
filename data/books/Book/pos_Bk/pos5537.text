The book and accompanying DVD are being used in a class I am taking on Photoshop Elements 4.  Both of them make it much easier to understand what 4 is capable of and how to use the program, especially the tools.  Without instruction, complimented by 1 on 1, I would not be able to use even a small percentage of the power of 4. 1 on 1 goes step by step in 12 chapters of "how to" fix, enhance, organize, and share photos
