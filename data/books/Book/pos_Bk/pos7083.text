So many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read this book, I was like "what the heck is wrong with my wife?"  After reading this book, I was more like "Ohhh, I know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!"  Great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.
