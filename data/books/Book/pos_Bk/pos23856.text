Americans who can't name five poets will name Allen Ginsberg.  In this case, that is good since he was one of America's Greatest Poets.  This book attest to this.  I write this review to show disappointment in the publisher who continues to publish the collected works on the cheapest paper next to newsprint.    For the next edition, I would like to see, at least in limited edition, a volume printed on quality paper which could last more than a few years before turning yellow.  Ginsbergs deserves better treatment
