        While Peter Jay Fernandez and Jay O. Sanders aren't the only actors to narrate the acclaimed Cross series, they certainly are among the finest.	With a host of television appearances to his credit (Law & Order, Cosby)  Massachusetts born Hernandez has also made his mark on Broadway in Jelly's Last Jam and The Merchant of Venice.  His voice has a tad of huskiness, which makes it all the more appealing as Cross.  In all, Fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the Alex Cross tales, so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene. 	To date, Jay O. Sanders has narrated over 50 audio books, and he's a perfect voice partner for Fernandez.  His experience includes off-Broadway roles in Shakespearean plays, which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone.  The voices of Fernandez and Sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling Cross stories to life.	It's a painful attention-getter when we listen again to how Cross lost his beloved wife, Maria - she was shot down before his eyes.   Her killer was never found; the case chalked off as another sick drive-by shooting.  Now, Cross has returned to being a psychologist, his children are thriving, and perhaps he may be able to love someone again.	However, a telephone call from John Sampson, his old partner,  changes all that.   Sampson wants Cross's help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in Georgetown. Of course, Cross can't say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie-in to Maria's death some years ago.	One more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of James Patterson read by two consummate voice performers.        - Gail Cook
