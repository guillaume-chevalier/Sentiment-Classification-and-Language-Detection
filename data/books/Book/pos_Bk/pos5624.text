If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. Hard's what makes it great." Manager Jimmy Duggan (Tom Hanks), of the Rockrod Peaches to his All-World catcher Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) in Penny Marshall's "A League of Their Own" (1992).I always think of that quote when I read these "discussions" of the great  (and sometimes the not so great) philosophers in the Amazon reviews. On the one hand we have the "professional" philosophers/Ph.D'swho appreciate the difficulty of their craft. On the other hand we have the "almost were's"/undergraduates who cannot abide the effort it takes to decipher prose that seems unnecessarily dense. And that is how it should be, else everyone would do it, and those of us with Ph.D.'s and tenure track jobs at good colleges and universities would be out of jobs and out of luck!As for Kant, let's all be glad he's not on the job market
