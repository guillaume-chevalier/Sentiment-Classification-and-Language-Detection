Well, I just wanted to say that I am purchasing this to learn more about what could be, my ancestor!  Yup!  My name is Jackie Kidd.  I have been forever interested in anything that has to do with Captain Kidd.  Get this, we all have nicknames at my job and I am called:  Captain Kidd.  People think I'm wacked, but I don't care.I think he was a good pirate, he just got caught.  I have been trying to trace my family tree to him.  Nothing is for sure just yet. But I wear my uniform well!  I have a pirate costume that I wear every Halloween.  I stand firm in my heritage, if this is who I am
