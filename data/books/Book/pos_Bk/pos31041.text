Roger Caras, a very talented writer and animal lover, takes us on a tour of Thistle Hill, his farm in Northern Maryland.  Anyone who loves cats, dogs and other animals will love this book.  Its gentle humor and compassion are quite absorbing.  I must confess to a certain amount of jealousy, though--I would love to have a home like Thistle Hill Farm
