explodes upon the crime-detective scene. THE HUNDRETH MAN, his first book was excellent and THE DEATH COLLECTORS is as good and even better. Can't wait for the next one!Why this is an Amazon sale item befuddles me. But since it is , grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel!The PSIT team of LAPD, Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus are faced with a dual-time mystery. More than 30 years in the past, a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him, is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced.And NOW; starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror. Each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of Carson and Harry. The touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.Perfect!The murders are freakish! Disgusting! Brutal! But the two PSIT detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old/new mystery will knock you out of your chair.A truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic 'partners against crime'. A series to follow and enjoy. Get both of Kerley's books and double your pleasure!Try them, you'll like them and you'll love Jack Kerley. I promise!!
