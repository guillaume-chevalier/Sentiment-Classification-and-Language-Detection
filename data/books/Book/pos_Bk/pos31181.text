This book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that Saudi Arabia is the way it is today. I was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore. It does get a little tedious when discussing the business/oil aspects of the 1960's and 70's, but it's well worth it. It's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time.
