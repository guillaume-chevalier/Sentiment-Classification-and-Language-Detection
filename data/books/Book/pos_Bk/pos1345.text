Because the ideas and strategies really work! Robert Allen gives more concrete information, real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book.I used the ideas from Robert Allen to buy my first home, nothing down 5 years ago and the value of my home has escalated BUT...the return on my investment on a nothing down deal is infinite! Hey...if you don't like Robert Allen, you can always read Jane Bryant Quinn and lose money with her advice. I was talking to a guy the other day in a book store who said he lost over 75% of his 401 (k) money following Quinn's "safe" advice.OR...you can read those tabloid websites which are around only to attract the naive and also are out to sell you their generic junk most of which is plagerized Robert Allen ideas
