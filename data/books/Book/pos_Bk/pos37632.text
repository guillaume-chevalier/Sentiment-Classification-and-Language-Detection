I discovered this in an airport bookshop and it is a great read on a flight. I takes some of the most insightful trend study and boils it down so that anybody can get their arms around why design is the most important factor in your business today. Yes any bussiness. This is my hyperbole Tom is much better at stating the case. But when a management guru like Tom puts out a visualy interesting as well as well thought out book like this it is time to take notice. Read and use or be left in the dust
