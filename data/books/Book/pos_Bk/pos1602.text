I bought this book just recently and was really touched (and cried) by the whole experience that Gus had went through. He has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance (Stephanie) and without her, he could've been out there on the street again. Overall, it's a good book to read and I always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another, this book is a genuine prove.
