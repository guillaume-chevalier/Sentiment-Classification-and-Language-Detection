These came yesterday and I started using them right away. I was able to learn (for recognition only) 12 new JLPT3 kanji in under 30 minutes so this product is definitely worth it. Before using this I learned all JLPT4 kanji by writing it over and over again on scratch paper. That was a more thorough method but Ive decided that for now, recognition is more important than writing so WRP flashcards are a big help. As others have noted, they have a nice look and feel to them. All Nihongo students should have this in their arsenal. You'll definitely have an advantage over fellow classmates who waste valuable time making their own flashcards.
