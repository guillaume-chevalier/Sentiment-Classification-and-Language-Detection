Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his "best" for last.  While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about:  Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out "who dun it"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life!I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail.  So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up!  Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth.  Good read
