I have just finished reading &quot;The Power of Ethical Management,&quot; and I thought it was well written.  In the past few weeks I have read several other books on business ethics and this one is my favorite.  It is  short and exact with great details on how to improve your corporation as  well as yourself.  This book not only can be applied to the work place but  in your life at home, family, friends, and children.  This book has helped  me greatly
