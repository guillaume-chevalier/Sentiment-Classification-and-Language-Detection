This book is NOT about ALL people. It is about gifted (in this case that means sensitive) children that are misused to feed their parents narcissism. Most children are not that sensitive and hence not suseptible to that specific abuse.It is possible to be gifted and not be sensitive, but those traits do trend together. I agree that reading this book is an emotional experience for those former children, but that is a necessary part of the healing process.This book pioneered the idea examine this from the child's perspective, and any subsequent critics need to consider this.I heartily recommend this book for those that have been affected, and the others should give their copy to the library, grateful not to have needed it
