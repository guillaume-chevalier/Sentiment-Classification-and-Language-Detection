Dr. Amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family.  The stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome. Understanding the root causes, particularly the genetic predisposition within families, is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems.  These problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse:  they do not deal with the biological root causes.  Once those are dealt with, the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life.
