It helped me place myself in the right direction as far as choosing a college. It's hard to choose colleges just by what you hear by older people but this book is extremely useful in information you need to know before  visitng a college. I would reccomand this book. The software was useful to  me, however if you know how to write a formal essay it's no big deal
