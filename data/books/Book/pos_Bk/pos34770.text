An ex-officer in the Argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered. I can't write &quot;highly recommended&quot; about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event. Just read it, you may not be able to sleep for few nights, but you'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes, supported by the United States only because they were &quot;anti-communist&quot;
