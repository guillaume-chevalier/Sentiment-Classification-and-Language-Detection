I'm almost finished reading this book, and what a long, fun ride it's been.  Wordy, and a little confusing, this book has to be taken in the right mood, or else you'll miss the humor.The places that the main character travels to are memorable and exciting, and I found myself getting through a hefty portion, without thinking that I had ever started.Some....no, more like most of the satire is cryptic, and hard to find.  However, I read up on the book, and it immediately popped out at me, and made alot more sense.This is an excellent book, that I'm sure you will enjoy.  It might even suit as a read-aloud story for younger children
