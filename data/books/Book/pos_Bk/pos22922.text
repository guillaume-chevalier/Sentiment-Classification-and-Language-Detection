The Miernik Dossier was shockingly good. Before this, I had never read anything by McCarry. In fact, I had never even heard the man's name. I was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. Now I am collecting everything by him.The story follows an odd assortment of people, some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents, as they travel south through Europe into Africa. For the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if Miernik is who he says he is. The writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure. In that sense the Miernik Dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel, but yet it goes way beyond that. It is also a highly compelling character study, with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters. This makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are.The Miernik Dossier is a highly entertaining read. True spy literature, in the vein of Ashenden, that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories, mysteries or simply great writing. I cannot wait to read this book again
