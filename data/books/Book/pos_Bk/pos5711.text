I used this book as a student and still use it for teaching.  Pieces are nice and students are challenged to think musically.  It moves quicker than some other method books; it covers materials from elementary to early intermediate.  Upon completion of the first grade book students can play standard repertoire in the early intermediate level.  Students must have completed early elementary level before using this book because this book starts with playing two hands in C position.  Emphasize phrasing from the first piece.  Highly recommended
