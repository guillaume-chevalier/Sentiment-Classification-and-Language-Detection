. . .maybe believe your suspenders, I'm not sure which.It seems to me that to enjoy this book,you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability. You also haveto give up any qualms you might haveabout a protagonist who's pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planetearth seems pretty improbable.What you get in return are some amazinglanguage, some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intensebut not cartoonish. Much too cerebral toever be made into a movie by any directoralive now, this is a book to be enjoyedas a pure artifact of whacked-out, butcraftsman-like writing
