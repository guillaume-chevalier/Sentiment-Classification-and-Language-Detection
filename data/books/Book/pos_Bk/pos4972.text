I expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read.  What I DIDN'T expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers.  From the opening pages of the book, as Wylie Jones prepares to depart on a &quot;business trip&quot; of unspecified duration, to the penultimate chapter, when a revitalized Wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the Left Coast, this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice, hints, tips, and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways!  Think of it as a kind of business allegory.  Wylie's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if Robert Fulghum were to meet John Gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike, set fire to Robertson Davies' beard, and then move on over to the Highway Hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than Warren Buffet, Everyone's Favorite Grassroots Investor.  I totally LOVED it.  It gets my absolute HIGHEST rating
