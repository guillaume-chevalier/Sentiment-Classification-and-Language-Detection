This is a colleciton of seven or so stories told by a mouse to mice about mice.  It is one of those books that is simply fun to read, particularly to the wee ones at bed time.  The illustrations are quite good and the nicest thing about the stories are that they are just about as much fun for the adult to read as it is for the kid.  Very nice illustrations, well done.  Recommend this one highly.
