Tim Russert is a great journalist and this book is a great resource for ideas and suggestions on how to be a better dad.  In fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was. The most precious things a father can provide are time, attention, and love.  This book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know. Great work! Keep it up, Tim!  -- I also watch most of Tim's TV programs.
