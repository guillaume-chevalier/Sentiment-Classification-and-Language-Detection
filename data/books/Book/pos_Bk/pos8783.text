The cover of this book compares it to The Kite Runner, so it caught my attention.  I honestly could not stop reading as "Yasmina Khadra" does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters.  He weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people's humanity.My only nit is the ending was a bit predictable.  That said, it was still a very good ending that rings true.  SPOILER:  If you wonder why she didn't come back, consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street, which led to them being stopped, which ultimately resulted in her husband's death.I honestly can't wait to read more by "Yasmina Khadra"
