I first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages.  The children were enthralled with the illustrations (as were many adults) but the &quot;message&quot; was deeply felt by the &quot;older&quot; child in all of us there.  It is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have.  Mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him, and brought him pleasure.  He wished that he could influence others, but never knew what his music did for the world.  Maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for.  The message is true for children and adults alike. I will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend, and from the pulpit. Thank you, David McPhail
