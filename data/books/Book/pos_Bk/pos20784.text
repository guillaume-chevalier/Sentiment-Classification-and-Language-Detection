Having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the Three Musketeer series, the following are my suggestions.1.  Read all five books in order.  The Man in the Iron Mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context.  Think of the Man in the Iron Mask as the dessert in a five course meal.  Dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable.  Getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that I was finishing a 3,500 page experience.2.  Read the Oxford University editions.  There are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events.  When you read 3,500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight.  The Introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter.3.  If you really like any one book in particular, go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection.  I purchased a used Three Musketeers with illustrations by Maurice Leloir.  The three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable.Along with Sir Walter Scott, Alexandre Dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel.  I have been reading these types of novels my entire life.  Beyond a doubt, Alexandre Dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre.
