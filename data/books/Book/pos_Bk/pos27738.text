Leonaur Ltd. is publishing the definitive Edgar Rice Burroughs 21st century editions. These usually contain 2 books of the different ERB major series in order - thus far John Carter, Pellucidar, and Carson of Venus. In the future, possibly Tarzan!These books are handsome and my rating is mainly based on this - the ERB fan knows best about the rest of it.This first volume of Joh Carter of Mars contains 2/3 of the greatest science fiction/fantasy trilogy ever. What is nore remarkable is that these were published over 40 years before Tolkien's LOTR and over 50 before Tolkien became fashionable. "A Princess of Mars", "The Gods of Mars", and "The Warlord of Mars" are ERB's greatest work.It is sad, in a way, that Tarzan obscures ERBs Mars novels for the general public. These books deserve to be beter known, and it is astonishing no movie or TV adaptation has ever been attempted (which might be a good thing, after all!). If only Steven Spielberg or Peter Jackson were interested!Of course, genre and ERB aficionados have long know and cherised these great stories. I wonder how many others were first attracted to these by the magnificent Ballantine editions of the 1960s?If you are a fan as am I, support Leonaur Ltd.'s efforts by buying these magnificent books.
