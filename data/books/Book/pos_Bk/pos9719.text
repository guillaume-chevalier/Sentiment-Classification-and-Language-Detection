This book is as close to perfect as you can get. I personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of India.Worth noting, the Mistry book, A Fine Balance, while good, is basically a full on rip off of this book. If you want the original, read Rushdie. Mistry should be ashamed. His is not even a different take, it is just another take of the same image and not as good
