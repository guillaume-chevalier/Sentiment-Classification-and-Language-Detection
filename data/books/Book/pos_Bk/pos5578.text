"When I first came to Iran, black clad women all seemed the same. Scary unsmiling servants of the Ayatollas"Having visited the Islamic Republic of Iran in June, I was better prepared for that vast country portrayed by Elaine Sciolino in her book Persian Mirrors. I am more than grateful for this book, which alerted me to the diversity of cultures, and the general way of life so absolutely different from the Western world.Elaine Sciolino made me so very aware of the perfect social world of the Iranians and also I am thrilled to say that once you make a friend of an Iranian, you have a friend for life.My most treasured memories of Iran will never leave me and I thank Ms Sciolino for preparing me for that journey.
