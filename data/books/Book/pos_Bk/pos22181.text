A quality photography book that visually recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and more specifically, the creation of the term noir as it pertains to film and photography in the 20th c. in New York  City.  A breath of realism, history and fact that beautifully illustrates a  fine curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the Daily News  that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real stories suffered  and celebrated by real people.  William Hannigan is to be commended for his  fine selection of photographic and negative samples of a time not long past  and still very alive in the movies and crime documents that inspire and  fascinate us today.  A necessary addition to any photo library of value
